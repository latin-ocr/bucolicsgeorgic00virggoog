281. It is conjectured that the fable of the giants striviug to pile Ossa on
Pelion had its origin in the fact that these two mountaina were originally
united and torn asunder by some strong convulsion of natiue, leaving the
valley between them covered with large pieces of rock. The exertions of
the giants in piling up one mountain on another are well represented'by the
sound of this verse, as Po e describes it, “The line, too, labora, and the
words move slow.” At each hiatus the next word begins with the same
vowel with which the preceding one ends, conati imponere, Pelio Ossam, thus
compellinga greater exertion of the voice iu order to prouounce it. See
Remarks on Seauning.

the werp, and made, by a sharp stroke, which caused a “shrill” sound, to' ,¹
drive the threads of the woof close together. ¹

297. madio aesta ,· commentators are at variance whether this means in the
middle ol the summer or in the middle of the day, against the former there
is, that Virgil would not give advice so entirely superfluous, against the
latter, that it is well known that laborare always slept for an hour, as they de
