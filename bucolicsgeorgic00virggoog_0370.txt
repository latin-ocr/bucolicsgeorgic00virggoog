ECLOGUE V.-DAPHNIS.

mannans. - Two shepherds, Mopsus and Menalcas, unite in bewailing
the death of Daphnis, and in celebrating his admission to divine honora
It is not quite certain whether Virgil bad any particular person in view
under the name of Daphnis. It cannot well apply to any ono butJulius
Caesar; and if we suppose him to be the hero of the poem, wa must con-
clude that Virgil, either to avoid giving offense, or in order to heighten tho
poetical interest of the subject, has not strictly confined himself within the
limita of historical truth.

This Eclogue was written U. C. 712, the year in which the deification of
Julius Caesar was solemnly proclaimed, in which a shrine was consecrated,
and public ceremonies and sacrifices were instituted in his honor, his birth-
day was ordered to be observed as a holiday, and the mouth in which he was ,
born called after bis namo.

Γ l, 2. boni - inflare -dicere; “ skillcd in playing, '' &a

4. maior, scil. nata “ the elder.’'

5. The shadows of the trees were “uncertain'’ i. e. tremulous or shifting
Δ as the breezes agitated them, motantibus, scil. eas.

6, 7. Aspice, ut - sparsit ,· the differente between the indicative and the sub-
junctive following at should here be observed; aspice at sparsit points out
merely the fact that the wild vine has overbung the cave; aspice at sparserit
calls attention, likewise, to the manner in which it has done so. In English
we should express this difference by a difference of intonation3 aspice, nt
sparsit, “sesi—how the wild vine has overhung the cave1'’ aspice at
sparserit, “ see bora the wild vinc has overhung the cavel ''

7. raris, not “fcw in number,” but hanging at intervals, “scanned'’ so that
the light shone between them into the cave.

8. cenat, “ contenda ”3 i. e. ventures to contend.

9. Quid, si idem certet ; ‘³ what '² of that, “ if he would '’ even dare to “ strive
to surpass Apollo ” himself “in song.’' Mopsus, as is evident from v. 15, is
piqued that Menalcas should speak of Amyntas as a rival to himself, and as·
serts the vanity of that person to be such, that he would think himself
more than a match for Apollo.

10‚11. Phyllidis, Alconis, Codri ; fictitious names of frequent occurrenco
in familiar pastoral poetry.

13. baee; he declines to sing what Menalcas asks for, and, in preference to
them, proposes another song, which he had latoly composed3 this use of iaec
as opposed to aa (qaae ta me canem vis) understood is worthy of observa-
tion.

14. alterna‚· he first carved some verses on the bark of a tree, aad then
sang them to an appropriate measure. modulari corresponds to our “setting
to musia.” Voss supposes the bark to have bceu strippcd off the trec ancl
written upon, but the custom of carving versas on the bark of living trees is
so often referred to by tbc ancient pocts, that such an interpretation is unne-
