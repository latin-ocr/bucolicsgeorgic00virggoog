5. menore Amaryllide, “to reccho (the nantel}= Amaryllis ”3 resonare is
here transitive, and followed by the accusative ; ropertius uses it with the
nominative in a similar passage: resorntnt milvi cynthio sava,- 11111111-
qugnlll’elttbollelnhmrllsahld ederewgdrprepmxtp'io 6101711111 words, signifying one who
has the care of oxen.

6- 10. Octavianus Caesar is here re resented under the character of the
master of Tityrus. The assiguing to him the title and honors of a deity
does not appear to be such extravagant fiattery‚ when we remember that, in
the preceding year, Antouy, Octavianus, and Lepidus erected and consecrat
ed a temple to Julius Caesar in the forum, and that subsequently divine
honors were actually pald to Augustus. ·

6. upum ‘⁶ security,’' freedom from anxiety on account of the exhdng
mlh. lisque odeo, “to such a degree '¹3 a common Lucretiau phrase. a

13. Protenas, “to a distance' 3 opposed to errare, “grazing at large,'’ m
line 9. —oeyen “ ead,” “ dejected.''

16. laeam 101111, 1111-111111111,1111111111)1 significa “stupid,’' “slow of
apprehension,’' as dexter signifies ‘⁶ ingenious,’' “ clever.”

18. This line is considered by the best commentatore 10 be spurious, and
was probably transferred to this place from ·Ε11. ΙΧ. 15. ¹

19. Sed tomen; these words are emplo ed together, in order to break off
the conversation and carry back the min to the former subject, which had

, been lost sight of. Compare Geor'.1.7a-da‚·dareis often used for

dicere5 so, also, occipere for andire. 1111111. II. 65.

21. laic nomae ,· probably Mantua; but the name is not mentioued. ·

22. depedcre5 Wagner supposes depellere to be used for pellere, because
the farm of Virgil was situated on higher ground than the town of Mantua,
and the lambs were, therefore, driven “ down ” 10 the marhot, the fact that
they were driven “ away ” from their feld seems, however, sufficieutly 1ο
account for the use of the word. According to Servius, however, depellere
· is here employed in its usual sense of “to wean”; quoin that case means
‘⁴ for which ’' instead of “to which.” This is undoubtedly the best interpre-
tation, since young lambs were carried to market, and not driven.

26. viburna, a low, flexible shrub; a species of wild vine; “the wayfan'ng
tree,'’ 01“Μ111)1 Guelder-rose.”

28. The greater part of the laborers employed upon the farms were
slaves, but some of these were occasionally made free, and continued to
serve their former master under the name libertini. Ti s is represented
as having formerly, so long as he was the lover of ates, been careless
about obtaining freedom3 but since he had become attached to Amaryllis,
he hed become more saving, and had travelled to Rome 101 the purpose of
purchasing his hberty‚ which the kindness 01 his master had enabled him to
do on easy tenus. According 10 Cicero, a careful slave ought to make the
price of his hberty in five 01 six years. Liberty, being worshipped as a god·
dess, is appropriately said remicere.

29. Candidzor, “ somewhat gray ”3 this epithet has perplexed 1011110111-
mentatore, as Virgil, when he wrote this Eclogue‚ was only in his twenty·
ninth year. But although the poet represents his own good-fortune in 1111
general description 01 Tityrus, it is by no means requisita that all the partic·
ulars should correspond, and in v. 47 Tityrus is expressly called sena.

30. post for posteo. Compare Aen. ΙΙ. 216.

31. It has been asserted that Rome and Mantua are designated by the two
mistresscs of Tityrus3 but there do not appear 10 be sufficient grounds 101
· supposing Virgil to have intended such an allegory.
