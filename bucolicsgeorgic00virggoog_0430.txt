Auster at particular reasons, and especially in early spring, was very cold,
and often accompanied hy hail.

264. galbaneos ; galbanum is thc concreted juice of a plant called serub,
which grows in Syria3 see Georg. ΙΙΙ. 415.

265. ultra· as the original meaning of uitro is eis vd πέραν or περαιόθεν,
so it sometimes, as in this passage, significs something contrary to the usual

raetiae.

270. centaurea, ‘⁴ centaury,’' of which theream two sorte, the greater aad

271. amelia· Martyn takes great pains to prove that thia plant is the
seme as Aster atticus (our “sturwort''), umeiius being only the rustic name
(fecere agricolae), and not that by which it was known at Romae it is very
common in Italy. Hoffmann, a German botanist, maintains, however, that the
description of virgil does not a ee with this plant, and other commentatore
have suggested the melilotus (Ίξηῐιζοίἰαηι officiante). Auctio, the dative for the
accusative, according to the Grec idiom.

273. uuo de cespite, explained by Martyn to be for reduc cespitosa, a root
whose fibres are„ thiekly matted tog‘ethcm but it may„simply mean “ from
ongiffiofddtierndrdpse] izdee'dtdrndddrvddd’delslillgtirlaetrdsusthscamvlvdidle, or the greater part, ι

279. adorato Baccho, ‘⁴ iu full-flavored, rich wine.’'

283. Arcadii magistri, i. e. Aristaeus. It is addent thet this supposed
discovery is founded upon a popular error. The carcasses of dead animala
are douhtless sometimes chosen by bees, aa well us by other insects, for their
abode, as was that of tha lion in which Samson found a swarm of bees and
honey (Judges XIV. 5-14). But bees would be found in such a place
only because the queen-bec had secuit to be a sefe and convenient place,
and had laid in it the egga from which the swarm was produced.

285. Imeuoerus, “putrefied.'’ —taierit “has generated.’'

287. Pellaei Canopi, “of Macedonian Canopus”; Pella was considered
the metropolis of Macedonia, and was the birthplace both of Philip and of

conquest of the country by the Macedonians and the foundation of the
neighbouring city of Alexandria.

289. farcita· during the periodical inundatione of the Nile, the inhabitants

the difficulties of this obscure passage, than by rejecting the lines marked with
asterisks, which he supposes to have been written by Virgil, but transferred ’

region, Pelusium is the eastern angle, being nearest to Persia, aud the
