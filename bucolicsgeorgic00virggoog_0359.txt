61. ηιιᾱοε, because no longer covered by the water.

63. It has been objected that thc Tigris is not a river of Rarthia, nor tho
Arar (now the Saone) a river of Germany, and that therefore, althou h the

eople of those countries should have changed habitations, they wo dnot
gave drunk of the wetere of those streame. But the term pererratis omm-

66. Oaxen, a river in the island of Crete, which is not mentioned by any
other classical author. The island is, however, sometimes called Oaxis, and
it is certain that there was a city in Crete called Oaxus, or Oxus. If it is
asked why Virgil should make unleamed herdsmen speak of a remote and
almost unknown river, it may be sufficient to point out, that, as Sc thia is
opposed to Africa, so the island of Crete in the south forms a namrafandth-
esis to that of Britain in the north. Ithas beon conjectured, with some
show of reason, that the adherente of the republican party, who were de-
prived of their property, were oonveyed as colonists into the remotest parts
of the empire. There is no positive roof of this fact3 bnt if it was the
case, this passage of Virgil admits of an easy explanation3 otherwise it
would seem difficult to conjecture why a simple herdsman, expelled fr m
his farm, should expect to visit those distant regions. Some of the carli t
editions readropidum cretae, and suppose the Oxus in Mesopotamia to bc
intended, rapidum would then be equivalent to rapacem, “carrying along
with it,’' auderato may mean any marly substance. Curtius, VH. 10, says
of tlrat river, Hic, quio limam vehat, turbidus semper. ·

68. En, ormnem en here signifies complaint. Meliboeus expects never
again to see his humble possessione, and breaks out into a passionata excla-
mation, “ What, shall I ever,’' &e

70. Heyne, and the commentators who follow him, interpret post by postea,
and make the passage mean, ‘⁴ Will it ever be, after a long time, that, soeing
(again) my patemal possessione, and the turfbuilt roof of my humble oot-
tagc, my (fonner) domain, I shall hcreafter wondcr at some few stalks of
grain (instead of the rich harvest now produced) l ’¹ The interpretation of
Warton‘is, however, more natural, and seems to elicit a better meaning.
Aristus, “harvests‚’' stands for years, as in Claudiau, necdum decimm calenses
oristas; it is natural that shepherds should measure tl1e years by the har·
vests. The passage would then mean, “ What! shallI every after a long
time, after the lapse of some years, scaing (once more) my domain, admire
