’ You corne sometimes when sweet sleep holds me aet,'' &a

38. hedera aiba,· compare Ecl. III. 39. Italy abouuds with evergreens
which are during a great part of the year of a rusty and disagreeable color,
whereas the ivy is always of a fresh aud lively green, “fairer than ivy'' is
not, therefore, so inappropriate a compliment as it at first appears to
be. Horace compares young girls to ivy, and old women to withered
leaves Ι. 25.

41. ’sardois herbis,· an herb, common in Sardinia, probably our celery·
leaved crowfoot3 the juice is poisonous‚ and among other epasmodic effecta
produces the horrible contortions of the foce which have given rise to the
term “ Sardonic laugh.'’

42. risco, “ butcher’s broom.”

44. si quis poda,- Thyrsis has found the day so long, that he chidea his
cattle for lingering on their way home now that they have done feeding.

the country, were still without chimneys‚ and the smoke escaped by the door.

52. cameram the wolf does not dread the flock, however great its ,number
may be. Catron would interpret cumeram by “ musical numbers,'’ music.

53. Stant signifies more than sont,· it is intended to indicate the season5
the trees “ are rigid ’' with fruit and berries.

57. vitio atris, ‘² from the excessive heat of the air.''

58. Liber, Bacchus—invidit, “has grudged.”

60. Jupiter, or aetiter, the upper atmosphere, which was supposed to he cou-
densed, and to descend in showers in order to fertilize the earth. Compare
Georg. II. 325. - Voss supposes the meaning to be, that Jupiter, as soon as
Phyllis appears, would become so enamoured of her, that he would descend
iu a shower to visit lrcr, and so revive the patched fields.

61. Hercules wore a chaplet of poplarleaves when he visited the insemel
reiiniifluaa, ar aestates.

70. Corydon Corydon est-cobis. This verse, the genuineness of which is

suspected yHeyne, but without which the poem would end too abruptly‚
evidently means that henceforth Meliboeus will consider Corydon to excel
all the other shcpherds in poctry. The Delphin edition interprete it, “From
that time Corydon has been a Corydon to me”; thetis, has appeared to de·
serve the reputation which has generally been attached to his name. Wag-
ner suggests another mode of translation: Cmydon est nobas is the sameas
Corydon eat noster ; “Corydon is the man for me.” The name is repeated

for the sake of adding emphasis.
