ECLOGUIl I.-TITYRUS.

Ansnnsrn. In the year of the city 711, Marlr Antony, Caesar Octavi-
anus (better known by his subsequent title of Augustus), and Lepidus unit-
ed together for the ¹purpose of defeating the republican party under Brutus

and Cassius, and o arrogating to themselves the supreme power over the
whole Roman empire. In order to secure the services and allegiance of the
veteran troops, they promised to divide among thern the lands of eigbteen
Italian towns, which had embraced the cause of Cassius. Among those
were Capua, Cremona, Rhegium, Venusia, Beneventum, and Vibone. Two
years bad not elapsed before their projecte were crowned with success, their
patriotie opponents dead, and their authority over the whole empire ab·
solutely established. One hundred and seventy thousand soldiers now
claimed the fulfihnent of the promises which bad boen made to them, and
a large portion of the fairest and richest part-of Italy became a prey to their
attterltlt‘tlrltlthstltffttltl terit? {hildilid
ers to whom it was assigned, and that of Mantua was added to ir, or, as is
more probable, they took forcible possession, and their leaders did not ven-
turo to oppose their violent proceedings. Among the Mantuans who were
thus suddenly driven from their farms was Virgil, who thereupon pmoeeded
to Rome, and, through the influente of Pollio, procured from Augustus the
restoration of his property.

It was in order to testify his gratitudo for this favor, that he composed his
first Eologue. His own happy lot is represented by the cese of Tityrus,
who, as he lies athis ease under the wide-sprendr'ng shado, watehes his
herds grazing in the mesdows3 while in Meliboeus, wearily driving a few
goats, we sce a touching picture of the fate of his less fortunato neighbours.
