nnn caesarca. —aoorz 11. 399

387. Oro; it was originally the custom to disguisc the face at the festivals
of Bacchus by smearing it with juices and colors; hence arose the practico
of wearing masks, and hence also they were worn by the actors in all dramat
re re resentations.

383. Osciilo ‚· oscillum, a diminutive, through amalus, from os, signifying “a
little face,'’ was the term applied to faces or heads of Bacchus, which were
suspended in the vineyards to be turned in every directionb the wind.
eriehever way they looked (v. 392), they were supposed to m e the vines
in that quarter fmitful.

396. veribus salurnis, “ on hazel spits,” perhaps because the hazel was con·
sidered hurtsul to the rine3 v. 299.

393. numnam mbousti satis est, “which never has enough of completion ’² ;
i. e. “which can never be done too much.''

401. nemus, “the vines-’'—labor actus, “the labor performed.''

402. sao per caspia “in its (old) track,” i. e. in its old course.

404. librarem this term is frequently applied by poets to the ‘⁴ foliage.”

405. acer, “ energetic.”

406. Satarru dante3 Satum was represented holding a pruning-hook.-
reiictam, stripped of leaves and fruit

409. It would appear that the vines were partly trained over trees, and
partly fastened to stakes and poles, these were removed after the vintage
· was orer, and placed under cover in order to reserve them.

410. meato, “ gather in” the harvest, i. e. tiis grapcs3 so also, in the next

410. ater rie labor ; i. c. pnming and wceding.
415. inuiti, requiring no cultivation, and therefore “uncultivated“
416. arbusta, the trees to which the vines are trained.
. 417. effectos 'extremam the common reading is carrenses effetus vinitor ames,
‘⁶ the weary vine-dresser sings (for joy) over the last rows of the vineyard ”.;
but it does not appear ‚that ψοίας can bc translated by “ weary,” in this sense
of the word. Wagner has therefore adopted the reading in the text, from
some of the best manuscripts, effectos uates being the rows of vines complet-
ed or finis ed.

be ulverized.

434. aid rnajora sequar? Wagner has adopted a new punctuation for
this passage, making majora refer to the trees mentioned below, 437-440;
and placing the intervening lines, Salices —meili in a parenthesis. He asserta.
namely, that when qaid is followed hythe indicative, it is the question of
a person discontinuing a subject commenced3 and that when it is followed
by the subjunctive, it is the question of a person about to make a slight men·
tion of something to follow. In proof of this assertion he adduces the
following passages: Ecl. VI. 74, Quid loquar at Scyllam Nisi, dac-3 Geo . 1.
104, Quid dicam, jactoqai semine, se, Aen. VI. 601, Quid mensem [opit f
