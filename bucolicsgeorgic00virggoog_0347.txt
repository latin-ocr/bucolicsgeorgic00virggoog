Caesar Octavianus, Lepidus, and Antony was formed, aud in the division 01
the empire which ensued, the territory 01 Mantua fell to the
U. G. 711. share of Antouy, who placed over it Asinius Pollio. It was in
this year that the third Eelogue, Palaemon, was eomposed, in
which the poet speaks with much wannth of Pollio, who had extended to him

this year was fought the battle of Philippi, after which Octavianus returned
to Rome, and proceeded 10 distribute among the victorious sol-
U. C. 713. diery 01 his party the lands of several Italian towns. Among
these was Cremona, butas the territory belonging 10 this town

swimming ever the river. Pollio, after the Perusian war, had been sue-
ceeded by Alfenus Varus, who likewise 111111ιάθά his friendshi to the poet,

time partly on his paternal property, and partly at Rome with
Maecenas. Horace has left us a poetical description of a joumey which he
made from Rome 10 Brundusium, in company with Maecenas,
U. C. 716. Plotius, and Varius, from which it appears that they were
Joined by Virgil at Sinuessa, it is probable, therefore, that bo
had now taken up bis residenee at Naples3 and as the seventh Eclogue, Meli·
boeus, was written before this change 01 abedo took place, we may conclude
that it dates from the early part of this year. The tenth and last, Gallus,
must have been eomposed at Naples3 for it was not until the close of the
· year that Agrippa crossed the Rhine and mnrcbed into Germany, and this
Eclogue was intended to console Gallus 101 the loss of his mistress, Lycoris,
who had deserted him and followed one 01 1111 officers of that army.
