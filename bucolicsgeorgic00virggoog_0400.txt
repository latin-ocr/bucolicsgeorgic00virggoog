nnn onoaems. -aoon 1. 389

415. tremuerunt,⁸ attributable probably to avalancbes.

479. sistant—debiscunt. Virgil seems in this and several other passages
to have increased the emphasis of particular lines by means of a kind of
rhyme, or at least similarity of sound; 111 subsequent times, Latin hexameters
were fre uently written with this rhyme3 compare Georg. I. 157.

480. ebur, anaqam the statues made of these materiale were covered with
moisture, owing probably to an unusual moisture in the atmosphere.

482. rer, because the largest of the rivers of Italy. The inundatione
caused by this river are frequently very destructive. - fluviorum ; the i is a
consonant3 see Remarks on Scanning.

484. fibroe; the small veins and nerves which run through the liver aud
unite together to form 1111 root of it. Itis recorded by Cicero, De Div. 1.
119, that when on this occasion the vistim was sacrificed caput in jecore nors

uisse.
f 485. The common reading, adopted also by Heyne, has cessavit: et altae,
making resonare the historical or absolute infinitivo independcnt of cessavit.
But the rhythm of the verse is destroyed by such a reading, and does not
admit of any pause 11111111αυὶ1,- et is ere used after out, instead of another
aut, in accordance with the frequent custom of the best Latin authors.

489. poribus telis, because Romans fought against Romans.

490. iterum3 this must, according to Ruaeus and Heyne, be taken with
1111111111, meaning that Philippi witnessed the second battle, i. 1. that be-
tween Octavianus and Brutus3 but the position of the words seems to require
iterum oiclere to be j0ined together. It is remarkable that other authors, espe-
cially Ovid, Lucan, and Petronius (cerno equidem pomino jam 1111111 morte Plu'· '
lippos, De Bello civ. 110), seem to spoak of two battles at Philippi, which
has led some persons to suppose that they confounded Pharsalia, where Cae·
sar defeated Pompe , with that place. The conjecture of Holdsworth (in
his Diss. upon Virgill, though reJ'ected by Heyne as unworthy of the poet,
seems to descrve consideration. It appears from Stephanus that Thebae
Phthiae near Pharsalus in Thessaly is also known by the name of Philippi,
and that Vir 'l therefore speaks of the two battles as having both been
fought at PhiPilppi, not the same place, but two places of the same name, in
order to impress the Romans with the belief, that the vengoance of the glotis
against the murderers of Caesar was denounced by omens, among w ich
heathen superstition would rockon the fact, thata second battle fatal to the
Romans should be fought ata place of the same name and 111 the same re·
gion with the first. For the same reason, he includes, in v. 492, both these
places 111 Emathia (Macedonia) though not strictly within its limits.

491. Nec fuit indignum superas, “nor did the gods think it unworthy ”3 i. e.
“ they saw fit ’³ to decree.

497, Grondio; as it was the popular belief that the then existing race of
men was far inferior to those of former times, so it was frequently represent·
ed by poete that future generations would still further degenerare, and
woqld thedrefore view the remains found upon 1111 barne-fietus of Philippi
wit won er.

498. Di patrii, Indigetem these were both tutelary deities, but of different
classes. The former were originally gods, that is, they were the powers of
nature personified3 the latter were men deified.

499. Palatia, the Palatina hill, where Romulus laid the foundations of the
cit ·.

100. juvencam Octavianus Caesar, then about thirty-one years of age.

502. Every great calamity was attributed to the anger of the gods3 and
here Virgil, who appears qq have already conceived the plan of tho Aeneid‚
