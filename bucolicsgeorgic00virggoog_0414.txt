namely Caesar Octavianus. By this temple is meant the great work which
Virgil bad theu already planned, the Aeneid, the chief design of which was to
magnif the character and person of Augustus, The poet further represents
himse aa presidiug at public gemes, instituted iu connectIou with his tem-
ple,- gamos, of which it is well known Augustus was passionately fond, - and
also as discharging the functione of the priestly office. In this character he
would lead the sacred processioa to the shrine which he goes on to describe ;
it would, after the manner of ancient temples, be surrounded by deors of
carved work and veiis, on which were to be wrought certain omemeuts.
These ornaments are the triumphs of Octavianus, aud he has indeed very
skilfully introduced them into the Aeneid. Among the remoter ornaments
of the temple are chiefly conspicuous the Trojan chiefs, from whom the
Julian family affected to derivo their pcdigrce. And lastly, to iudicate the
glory of the whole, Envy is introduced shudden'ng at the sight of such per-
ection. .

of the stage was painted on a triangular machine, so formed as to turn u on
a pivot; each side presented a different subject, and the scenos were e ' ted
by turning round this machine.

25. The curtaiu which concealed the scene was drawn down, aud not up
as with us, when the play began, and rolled ou a roller under the stage;
when the play was over, it was drawn up, and in this case the figures of Brit-
ons wrought upon itare supposed to have the appearance of raising it up.
Ovid thus illustrates the rising of the warriors w en Cadmus had sown the

“ Sic, ubi tolluntur festis aulaea theatris,
Surgere signa solent; primu ue ostendere vultum,

we must conclude that they were added by Virgil some time after thc com·
pletion of the Georgics, and subsequently to the defeat of the Cantabri
