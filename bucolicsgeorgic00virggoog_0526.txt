151. This line is rejected by Wagner, principally in compliance with a law
laid down by Brunck, that words ending in ius and inm formed their enitives

Angustus, when the form ii was introduced by Propertius and Ovid. But
Jahn, Forbiger, and other critica have satisfactorily proved that this law
was not strictly observed, and that, independently of thia verse and flavii,
in Aen. III. 702, which have for this reason been pronounced spurious, there

are undoubted exemplos of the later form in Enniusand Lucretius. Jahn =

justly' observes, that Propertius and Ovid would not have ventured upon
suddenly making such a change, and that there must have been some ex·
amples of it in preceding Latin writers3 at all events, the existence of tho
law in question ia not sufficiently certain to justify ns in rejecting a verae,
