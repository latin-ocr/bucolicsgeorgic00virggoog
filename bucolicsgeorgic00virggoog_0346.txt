LIFE OF VIRGIL.

--.....-...-.

Niciam· all the information which we possess respecting Virgil is derived
from a life of him, written, or pnrporting to have been written, by Donatus,
the grammarian, who lived in the fourth centuiy of the Chiistian era But
of the particulars which he relatas, many are'evideiiti''”mareuonjectures,
some are idle fables, and some are undoubtedly false. These which appear
ιο be most worthy of credit are here presented ιο the reader, arranged in
chronological order, with the addition of such references ιο passing events
in Roman history aa may throw light upon the life and character of thc
poet. Publius Virgilius Marem bornen-the tithei-October, at
U. C. 684. Andes, a vill ,ιιι the neighbourhood of Mantua. The exact

ciaet this ⁸ 'eis a matter of uncertainty3 but the modern

Mantuans believe it ιο be that now called Pietola, which is, however, only

two miles from Mantua, whereas the distance of the ancient Andes from

that cityis stated by Probu's ιο have been three miles. Virgil’s father was

what we should call a gentleman, owning amederate estate, the cultivation
of which he su erintended3 his mother's name was Maia.

nt little is known respecting the early life and education of

U. O. 696. Virgil. The grammarians have given minute accounts respect·

whom he derived instruction, but it is evidcnt that these accounts are

founded upon mere conjecture. There can, however, be no doubt that he

enjoyed the advantages of a liberal and refined education, and it is supposed

that he gassed some years forthis purpose at Cremona and Mantua, where
he conl enjo advantuggs of a higher order. According to'Donatus,he -ὶ
ο visited aples and Rome, bnt the truth of this statement

U. O. 699. is very questionable. When he hed attained his sixteenth
year he assumed the virile toga.

The poetical talenta of Virgil began ιο display themselves even during
his boyhood. Among the ieces which he comlposed at an early age were
Epigrams, the Moratum, irae, and Culex. oems under these names
have been handed down to us, but it is strongly suspected that severalil
not all of them, are the compositione, not of Virgil, but of some writers of
a later age, who passed them off for the lost productione of the poet. Of

his acknowledged works, the earhest was the second Ilclogue,
U. O. 709. entitled Alexis, which, according to the conjectures of Martyn
and others, was written in this year, and there is interiial
evidence to prove that it was one of his earliest productione.
