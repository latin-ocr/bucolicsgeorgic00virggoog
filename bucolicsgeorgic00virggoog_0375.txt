64. The introduction of Gallus, a friend of Virgil, into the midst of these
fables from the ancient mytholo y, appeared so much out of place to Heyne,
that he concludes these lines to ave been transposed, and would insert vv.
74-81 before this line. It would appear, however, from the words Quid
loquar, with which v. 74 commences, that 1110 poem is drawing to its close,
and it would therefore be improper to remove 1110111 41001 their place. Be·

lats, virides apio ripae, Georg. IV. 121. But apiani is generally considered to
