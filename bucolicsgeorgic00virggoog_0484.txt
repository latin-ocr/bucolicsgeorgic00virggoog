197. nesus, “disgrace ”3 bac nefas must be joined together.

199. Subtrahitur solum, “the surface of the seais drawn away (i. e. ap·
pears to glide) from under them.”

201. ipre has here the signification of solua· compare Georg. ‚1v. 201,
note. -r se casus, “ a mere accident.”

203. nterior,· see above, v. 170.-iuiquo,“narrow.'’

205. murice, “a sharp projecting rock.”

207. morantur 3 Servius explains this by retro opum, and Wagner suggests
that it may be a technical term employed by sailors, perhaps corresponding
to our “back water.’' The more natural interpretation is, owewer, “censo
rowing,” i. e. while they are endeavouring to force the ship off the rocks.

spre .‘ “

212. Prona, “unobstructed.''

215, 216. exterrita tecto, “frightened from her dwelling.”

217. This line has often been cited as one of the most beautiful instantes
that can be produced of the sound’s being an echo to the senso. Pitt hus

“ Her pinions polsad, through liquid alr she s nugs,
And smoothly glides, nor moves her levell wlngs.'’

ple.” -duptut Maeandro, “in a double waving line.‘’

252. puer rapina· Ganymede.

255. Wagner remarks that Virgil has here forgotten himself, since the
same picture could not represent Ganymede pursuing the stags, and at the
same time being carried up into the sky. But we need not suppose that it
did represent both, it represented Ganymede at the moment when, while
he is engaged in the chose, the engle has just pounoed. upon and commenood

or occupation which is unfinished, and to the mind still continuing, while
tho sudden aud swift aot by which that occupation has been interrupted is
well expressed by the perfect tense, rapuit.
