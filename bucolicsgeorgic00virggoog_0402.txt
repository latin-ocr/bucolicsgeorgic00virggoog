in that vicini .

19. sc sabjictck “grows up.” Compare Ecl. X. 74.

20. bis, “hy these,'’ i. e. the natural methods.

22. via, “ by art.’' ’

23. abscindens‚· this was formerly the common reading, and is sanctioncd
by some of the best manuscripts. Heyne, who has been followed by most
modern editors, has substituted abscidens. But the former is here the
proper word, abscidi is said of things which are cut with aknife, or which
may be metaphorically said to he so cut, as oratio αόεείεας but abscindi is
used of things which are separated by any kind of force. “ Suckers ’' (plan-
tac) are not cut from “the parent plant'’ (de corpore marrim), but tom off
with a portion of the roots.

25. The second method described by Virgil is by means of settings, which
are taken from the main branchos, and are either cleft iu four at the end
planted 'm the ground (quadrifidas suda& or cut to a fomt (acuto robore).

26. propaginis arcas ; the third me od is bv “ ayers”; this mode of

gopagatmg, which is chiefly used for vines and other shrubs, oonsists in

nding down the branehes aud inserting the ends into the ground3 when
they have struck out roots, they are cut off and transplanted. ⁴

27. aaa terra3 because the same in which they are themselves growing.

ἓξ. cacurnyentfi another method is hy cuttings taken from the young shoots
at eto ο etree.

30. aidanus eectt's ‚· this, the fifth method mentioned b Virgil, ie said to
be still practised in Spain: they divide the trunk (ca icibua sectis) of an
olive-trae into several pieccs and bury them in the grontm, where each puts
forth roots and produces a trae.

32-34. The last method described is by grafting, so that the peartree
bears apples and the semel-trec plums. Martyn, Jahn, and Forbiger sup se
the cornel to be grafted on the plum; but as Virgil himself speaks o the
cornel-berry as unfit for human food (Aen. ΠΙ. 649), it is better to adopt the
interpretation of Wunderlich and Keightley, supposing corna to be used sor
aornos, as poma, v. 426, for pomi.

at. terrac ,· wau is one of the words whiehis sometimes used in the sin·
gular and sometimes in the plural; when speaking of the soil as producing
trees and plants, Virgil generally uses the singular, here, however, it refers
to undefined tracts of land. -Ismara ; Ismarus, pl. naut, Ismara, a moun-
tain of Thrace, was from the earliest times celebrated forits wine.

38. Taburnum: a mountain in Campania famous for olivcs5 both these
mountains were naturally rugged and barren.

39. Having stated the subject to be treated of in this book, the poet in·
vokes the favor of his patron Maecenas-decurrere is generally applied to
the circus, but sometimes also to ships, as Aen. v. 212.

41. da vcia, spread your sails3 i. e. receive favorably my poem.

44. primi iace litoris oram, keep close along the edge of the nearest shore.

“ 45. Inmanibnstcrraa; land is within reach, or, as we should say, within
sight. -carmincficto, fables or mythical stories.

47. oras; this reading is to be preferred to auras, although the latter is
found in thc greater number of manuscripts. If Virgil had written auras he
would have said ad luminis aaraa‚· in auras is not used of objects which do
not rise eompletel off from the earth, and could not therefore be applied
to trees. Thus, en. VI. 554, atat ferrea turris ad auras, while Aen. V. 520,
aerios idum contendit in aeras. -qnac, sestam ⁸

49. solo natura cobesa· “there is in the soil tho natural capacity ’' and
strength for their production.
