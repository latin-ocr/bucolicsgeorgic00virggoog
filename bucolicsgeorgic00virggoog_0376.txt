74. It seems tolerably certain, that the common reading of this lina is
corrupt, the construction of the whole passage is obscure, and the poet as·
cribes to Scylla the daughter ol Nisus what really applies to Scylla the
daughter of Phorcus, though, with regard to the latter point, it may be re·
marked that this is not the only slip of the kind which the poet has made.
Doeriug has proposed an emendation, which Wagner ap roves os: Quid
bavar, vt Scyllam Mai, nra quumfoma secata est, dre. Thus Silenus would be
represented as relating tha stories of both the Scyllas; but it isdifficult
to conceive how such an important word can bave been dropped from the
text. The order of the words is, Quid baqvvr, vt (Silenus) novaverit Scyllsvm,
Nisi (fiiiapsp, qvam fama secvta est (for qivamservnt), duc.

nuncubi] VIL-MELIBOEUS.

Arandara-Meliboeus, while seeking a stray goat, ehanees tofind
Corydon and Thyrsis engaged in an amaeboean contest (see argument ιο
Eclogue 111.) and Daphnis acting as umpire. At tha request ot' tha latter
he remains to assist him in giving jndgment, and they swerd the prize to
Corydon. The two shepberds alternately recita quatrains, or sannas of
four verses, which are epigrammatic inform aud wholly nnconnected with
each other, although Thyrsis, in accordanca with the laws of the amaeboaan
contest, strives iu each quatruin to excel what Corydon had just sung.

Some commentatore have supposed that by Corydon is meant either Gallus
or Pollio, and by Thyrsis some rival poet, but there do not appear to be any
sufficient grounds for such a coniectura.
