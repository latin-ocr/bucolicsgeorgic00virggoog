624. resupinus, “lyingon his back.” Heyne interprcts it “heading back·
ward,'' in order to hurl them with greater erce, but the sense of the whole

er, and appears somewhat unmeaning ifHeyne's version of resupinae is
adpppdfflm sui, “forgctful of himself,” i. 6. ol the cunning which is

661. Some editions conclude this verse with the words Accola fistula pendet,
