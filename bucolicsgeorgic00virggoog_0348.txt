slow writer, and spent a great deal of time in polishing 1110 verses; and
the Georgica, above all his writings, bear the evidence of extreme care and
great labor. It was during the period that he was engaged upon this work,
that hostilities commenced between Angustus and Antony, and

U. 0. 723. it is reported that Virgil expressed a desire to accompany the
former when he was pre aring to place himself at the head of

his forces. There is a passage in the Georgica I. 509, which bears refer·
