173, 174. supas stiouqae, 101 stivafapinea. Compare Ecl. VIII. 95, note.

174. curras imos; these words have led Voss and other commentators 1ο
suppose that the plough described b Virgil had wheels; but such, itis well
ascertained, was uot the case. aguet reads carna: but this word does
not seem applicable to the motion ola plough. Catullus apphus currus
eren to a ship, and it may here be used 101 1110 plough itsclf, or 101 1110 lower
part 01 11, which is, as it were, the body 01 avehicle.

175. ffiplorat, “ searches,’' i. e. penetratas every part so as thoroughly to

183. oculu capti ; a person or animal is said 10 be captus (capatus) 10 any
limb, who is held captive as 10 that member, i. e. preveutcd from using it.
Servius remarks that Virgil improperly applies the term to moles, inasmuch
as it is legitimately used only 01 such as have enjoyed aud lost the use 01
1110 limb iu question.

187. Contemplator, “ watch,’⁷ “examine 0110011101γ.”-000, “ the almond-

102. 1111ᾳαὶ010000 pinques palea, “ uselessly rich in ehaff.”

106. Servius and Heyue connect this line with the preceding, aud place a
1011 stop at the end 01 11; properata tunderent then means that they may boil
quickly, i. e. when they are to be caten as 0 vegetablc. But this seems alto-
gether out 01 placo, nor does trudere, strictly speaking, mean ‘⁴ 10 boil,'' but
“to bc soakcd'’ Virgil has been speaking 01 the practice 01 steeping the
seeds which they are about to sow 10 01110 aud lces 01 oil; he now mentions
another custom, (one still very prevalent) 01 soaking them iu tepid water,
iu order to hasten the germinatiou, but says that seeds thus treated, however
carefully selected, arc apt to degenerata.

200. ruere, referri ; the infinitiva absolute, which is commonly, but somo-
what incorrectly, 10101οᾶ 1110 historical infinitiva, is frequently used to express
that which is went 10 happcn.

202. Α1101 retrahit, retro sublapsus refertur must be supplied from v. 200.

203. rupit; Wartou adduces this and several other sentences 10 which
Virgil has made 000 01 1110 perfect and the present in the same sentence, in
order to prove that these two 100000 coincide. But the change 01 10000 10
011 111000 passages proceeds in fact from the 011011 which langnugc makes to
adapt itsclf 10 1110 rapidity 01 thought. Iu the picture here presented 10 us,
