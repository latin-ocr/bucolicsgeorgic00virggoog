Tomb 01 Virgil still forms an object 01 curiosity. He is said to 1101000111
posed his own epitaph, as follows : - -f

Mantua me genuit, Calabri rapuere, tenet nunc
Parthenope: cecini pascua-rura, ducas.

The Aeneid at the time 01 Virgil's death was unfinished, or at least it had
not received those corrections and final touches which the author dcemed so
important, that, on his death-bed, he amnestly requested that the poem
might not be ublished, but committed to the flames. Augustus, however,

As 0110011Ῑί131] has dwaysgbeen very fortunate, his writin brought

, himemo ument and fame during his lifetime, and, even downto epresent

time, the common consent 01 mankind places him in the first rank 01

parisons are always 11001111310111111101010111001101101011 harmonicus. But
notwithstanding all these excellences he cannot he called a great poet, for
he is wholly deficient in origimtlity: there never was an author who more
· lreely availed himself 01 the ideas 01 others, he is, in fact, the poet 01 art,
and not 01 nature. N or did he possess skill in the delineation 01 character,
his heroes all resemble one another, and, with the exception 01 Dido, there
is not 011001 his female characters in whom tho reader can 1001 any deep
interest. Virgil, therefore, must be placed in the second rank of poets, aad
this is the position assigned 10 him by Johnson, Coleridge, Sonthey, and
other able critics. Bnt the purity of his style, the morality 011110 senti·
